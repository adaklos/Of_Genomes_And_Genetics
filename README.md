# Of Genomes And Genetics


## **About the project**


*The project is based on* [HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-genetic-testing/).
*The task was to precit genetics disorder and disorder subclass based on medical information about children who suffer from genetic disorders.*

*The big part of the project was data cleaning and supplementation. There was also conducted exploaratory data analysis. Few models were trained and some problems with dataset were revealed.*


**Libraries used:** 
*  *pandas*
* *numpy*
* *matplotlib.pyplot*
* *seaborn*
* *sklearn*

**Techniques used:** 
* *multiple classification modeling*
* *grid search* 
* *train test split*
* *principal component analysis*
* *piepelines*
* *one hot encoder*
 </br>

## **Confiusion matrix for Logistic Regression Model**
 *Some disorder subclasses were easier to detect with trained model. However dataset doesn't seem to be well suited for this kind of prediction.*

*3. To get better results we should:*
   * *gather more data, espacially for disorders with the smallest amount of instances or drop them from the model*
   * *gather more relevant data from medical institutions - for example they should check what variant of the gene was inherited      from the parents and collect data about more specific symptoms*
